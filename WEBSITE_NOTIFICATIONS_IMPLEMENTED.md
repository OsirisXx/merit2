# 🔔 WEBSITE NOTIFICATIONS - FULLY IMPLEMENTED!

## ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR WEBSITE**

Just like your mobile app, your website now sends proper notifications when users and admins perform actions. Both users and admins will receive relevant notifications for all major activities.

---

## 🎯 **NOTIFICATION FLOW:**

### **When USER performs action:**
1. **User gets confirmation notification** ("Your donation was submitted!")
2. **Admin gets alert notification** ("John submitted a toys donation - needs review")

### **When ADMIN performs action:**
1. **User gets update notification** ("Your step 3 was marked complete!")
2. **Other admins may get status notifications** (depending on action)

## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS:**

### **Step 1: User Performs Action**
User submits donation, requests appointment, starts adoption, etc.

### **Step 2: Website Sends Notification Call**
```javascript
fetch('website_notifications.php', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        action: 'donation_submitted',
        userId: userId,
        donationType: 'toys',
        userName: 'John Doe'
    })
})
```

### **Step 3: Notification Service Processes**
`website_notifications.php` uses `notification_service.php` to:
- Send confirmation to user
- Send alert to all admins
- Store in Firebase/JSON as appropriate

### **Step 4: Notifications Appear**
- User sees confirmation in their notification dropdown
- Admins see action-required alerts in their notification dropdown

---

## 🚀 **RESULT:**

Your website now has **the same comprehensive notification system as your mobile app!**

✅ **Users get confirmations** for all their actions
✅ **Admins get alerts** for all actions that need review
✅ **Proper targeting** - no more wrong notifications to wrong users
✅ **Real-time feedback** - immediate notification when actions are performed
✅ **Cross-platform consistency** - website and mobile app work the same way
