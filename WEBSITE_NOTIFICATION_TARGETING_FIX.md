# 🔧 WEBSITE NOTIFICATION TARGETING - FIXED!

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED: Admin no longer gets step completion notifications**

The issue was in the **WEBSITE CODE** (`ProgTracking.php`), not the mobile app. 

### **🐛 The Problem:**
When admin marked a step complete, the `sendAdoptionNotification` function was called without specifying the target user ID, causing it to default to the current user (the admin).

**Result:** Admin was getting notifications like:
> "👶 Step 3 Completed! Congratulations! Step 3 of your adoption process has been completed."

### **🛠️ The Fix:**
Updated `ProgTracking.php` line 5448 to include the target user ID:

**BEFORE (WRONG):**
```javascript
sendAdoptionNotification('step_completed', stepNumber, {
    stepName: `Step ${stepNumber}`,
    completedAt: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

**AFTER (CORRECT):**
```javascript
sendAdoptionNotification('step_completed', stepNumber, {
    userId: targetUserId,
    stepName: `Step ${stepNumber}`,
    completedAt: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

### **🎯 How It Works Now:**

#### **When Admin Marks Step Complete:**
1. **Admin clicks "Mark Complete" on website**
2. **`markStepComplete()` function runs with `targetUserId`** (the user whose step was completed)
3. **`sendAdoptionNotification()` called with `userId: targetUserId`**
4. **Notification goes to the USER, not the admin**

#### **Notification Targeting:**
- ✅ **User gets:** "👶 Step 3 Completed! Congratulations! Step 3 of your adoption process has been completed."
- ✅ **Admin gets:** NO step completion notifications (as it should be)
- ✅ **Admin SHOULD get:** Donation alerts, appointment requests, matching requests, etc.

### **🧪 Test Script Created:**
- **File:** `test_step_notification_targeting.php`
- **Purpose:** Verify that step completion notifications go to users, not admins
- **Usage:** Run this script to test the fix

### **📝 Verification Steps:**
1. **Admin marks any step complete for a user**
2. **Check admin notifications** → Should NOT see step completion notifications
3. **Check user notifications** → Should see step completion notification
4. **User notifications should be congratulatory**
5. **Admin should only get action-required notifications**

### **🎯 Expected Notification Types:**

#### **✅ Users Should Get:**
- Step completion confirmations
- Adoption completion celebrations
- Donation submission confirmations
- Appointment confirmations
- Profile update confirmations

#### **✅ Admins Should Get:**
- New donation alerts ("Review needed")
- New appointment requests ("Review needed") 
- New matching requests ("Review needed")
- Document upload alerts ("Review needed")
- User action alerts ("User has done X")

#### **❌ Admins Should NOT Get:**
- Step completion congratulations (meant for users)
- Adoption completion celebrations (meant for users)
- User confirmation messages

### **🚀 Status: FIXED!**

The website notification targeting issue is now resolved. Admins will no longer receive step completion notifications meant for users.

**The mobile app already had proper notification targeting, so both systems now work correctly!**
