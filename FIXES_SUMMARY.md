# Ally System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Account Verification (isVerified false after signup)
**Problem**: After creating and verifying an account, `isVerified` remained false in Firestore Database.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added Firebase Auth trigger in `functions/src/index.ts` (`onUserEmailVerified`)
- ✅ Updated `Signup.php` to properly handle email verification flow
- ✅ Cloud function now automatically sets `isVerified: true` when email is verified
- ✅ Added `verifiedAt` timestamp for tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/index.ts` - Added Auth trigger
- `Signup.php` - Updated verification flow

### 2. Step Locking in Adoption Progress
**Problem**: Steps should be locked when previous step isn't done.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Implemented proper step locking logic in `ProgTracking.php`
- ✅ Steps are now locked until previous step is completed
- ✅ Admin controls show appropriate messages for locked steps
- ✅ Automatic unlocking of next step when current step is completed
- ✅ All subsequent steps remain locked until their turn

**Files Modified**:
- `ProgTracking.php` - Updated step locking logic

### 3. Notification System
**Problem**: No notifications appearing (collection-based notification system needed).

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created proper notification collection structure (`notification_logs`)
- ✅ Enhanced `simple_notification_system.php` with POST handlers
- ✅ Created `init_notifications.php` to initialize collection
- ✅ Proper notification fields: userId, processType, notificationType, title, message, data, timestamp, status, isRead, icon, id

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `init_notifications.php` - Collection initialization
- `simple_notification_system.php` - Added POST handlers

### 4. Admin Appointment Notifications
**Problem**: When admin cancels and accepts appointments, there should be notifications.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added notification functionality to `Appointments.php`
- ✅ Admin accept/cancel actions now send notifications to users
- ✅ Proper notification messages for appointment status changes
- ✅ Changed appointment cancellation to update status instead of deletion

**Files Modified**:
- `Appointments.php` - Added notification functions

### 5. Cancelled Appointments in User History
**Problem**: Remove cancelled appointments from "My History".

**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated `user_history.php` to only show completed appointments
- ✅ Cancelled appointments no longer appear in user history
- ✅ Maintained admin history view with all appointment statuses

**Files Modified**:
- `user_history.php` - Updated appointment filtering

### 6. Donation Tracking Issues
**Problem**: Tracking Donation shows "undefined" values and missing pictures.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Fixed undefined values in donation detail display
- ✅ Added proper fallback values for description, quantity, pickup address, contact
- ✅ Added support for multiple donation images (`imageUrls` array)
- ✅ Added single image support (`imageUrl`)
- ✅ Improved field mapping for different donation types

**Files Modified**:
- `Donation.php` - Fixed donation detail display

### 7. Track Your Donation Restrictions
**Problem**: Track Your Donation should only be for money, medicine, and education.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Restricted tracking to only money donations (donations with amount field)
- ✅ Added clear note about tracking restrictions
- ✅ Created `fetchTrackableDonations()` function
- ✅ Only shows Medicine Sponsorship and Education Sponsorship donations
- ✅ Filters out item donations (toys, clothes, food, general education)

**Files Modified**:
- `Donation.php` - Added tracking restrictions

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Account Verification
1. Create a new account at `Signup.php`
2. Check email and click verification link
3. Verify in Firestore that `isVerified` is now `true`

### 2. Step Locking
1. Go to `ProgTracking.php` as admin
2. Verify steps 2-10 are locked initially
3. Complete step 1, verify step 2 becomes unlocked
4. Try to access step 3 - should remain locked until step 2 is complete

### 3. Notifications
1. Initialize notification collection: `init_notifications.php?init=1`
2. Perform actions (appointment accept/cancel, donation submission)
3. Check `notification_logs` collection in Firestore

### 4. Appointment Notifications
1. As admin, go to `Appointments.php`
2. Accept or cancel an appointment
3. Check notification was sent to the user

### 5. User History
1. Go to `user_history.php`
2. Verify only completed appointments show in history
3. Cancelled appointments should not appear

### 6. Donation Tracking
1. Go to `Donation.php`
2. Click "Track Your Donations"
3. Should only show money/medicine/education sponsorship donations
4. Verify all fields show proper values (no "undefined")

## Database Collections

### notification_logs
```json
{
  "userId": "string",
  "processType": "ADOPTION|DONATION|APPOINTMENT|MATCHING|SYSTEM",
  "notificationType": "PROCESS_INITIATED|PROCESS_APPROVED|PROCESS_REJECTED|STATUS_UPDATE",
  "title": "string",
  "message": "string", 
  "data": "object",
  "timestamp": "number (milliseconds)",
  "status": "sent|delivered|read",
  "isRead": "boolean",
  "icon": "string (emoji)",
  "id": "string (unique)"
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Deploy Firebase functions: `cd functions && npm run deploy`
2. Initialize notifications: Visit `init_notifications.php?init=1`
3. Test all functionality in sequence
4. Monitor Firestore for proper data structure

All fixes are backward compatible and maintain existing functionality while adding the required improvements.
